# Odlaw's Quest v2

Simple Lua/Love2D game. Controls: WASD keys to move, Arrow keys to attack directionally (up = attack up, etc).

## Todo (a lot)
1. Add increasing difficulty
2. Add a timer (a la Vampire Survivors)
3. Fix known issues.

## Known issues
1. Enemy attack collision does not work properly. This is the end of development (for now)
