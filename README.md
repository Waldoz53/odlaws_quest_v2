# Odlaw's Quest v2

Simple Lua/Love2D game. Controls: WASD keys to move, Arrow keys to attack directionally (up = attack up, etc).

## Todo (a lot)
1. Add enemy movement
2. Spawn multiple enemies
3. Increment score on killing enemies
4. Add hp penalties for getting hit
5. Add increasing difficulty
6. Add a timer (a la Vampire Survivors)
7. Fix known issues.

## Known issues
1. Hit boxes aren't accurate. Reason: Pixel art dimensions are slightly weird
